# Global Computational Law School

This is a placeholder for an emerging project...

## Status

We are currently in discussions on the structure and sponsorship for advancing this concept at Tsinghua Law School and other collaborators around the world.  

On December 15, 2018 Tsinghua Law School convened the Computational Law Forum which explored key topics and brought together global thought leaders to present their research and ideas on this new field of law.  We intend to extend and advance this good start in the days and years to come.
